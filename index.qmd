I'm a research master's student passionate about biostatistics and innovative clinical trial methodologies. My work focuses on exploring the impact of interim analyses and comparing platform and parallel-arm trials, particularly in controlling type I error rates. Outside of my studies, I enjoy acrobatics and gymnastics and find relaxation in cooking.
